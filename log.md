## 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 23: Januray 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. #Javascript30 lesson 16 today. css text shadow on mouse move. 

**Thoughts**: Typical Saturday. Logged about an hour coding. @wakatime log keeps me accountable :-)

###Day 22: Januray 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @WakaTime 2:32 #javascript30 local storage and event delegation. Up to lesson 12 w/ @wesbos React course.

**Thoughts**: Javascript30 course was a longer one today... 30 minutes. Learned how to use localStorage and view that output in DevTools. Getting well into the React course by @wesbos. Starting to get more interesting as the prior lessons didn't give anything new (much). 

###Day 21: Januray 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox @wesbos course. Then started his React course. 

**Thoughts**: Wes is a good teacher. Got a grasp on flex. 

###Day twenty: Januray 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #javascript30 again for an hour

**Thoughts**: objects and arrays referenced vs copied. Buying more courses than i have brain to shove them into. Todd McLoud's goland webdev course, stephen grider just released 2 new courses. wesbos react course in the cart. Overwhelming myself, but those are my targets.

###Day 19: Januray 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 1:14 working with #Javascript30

**Thoughts**: Lessons 12 and 13: Key sequence detection. Worked more with JS event listeners and arrays. Got a solid understanding of the .splice method. .join method as well... converting array values to csv string and analyze. Lesson 13 would slide an image into its space once the page is scrolled half way down into the image's x/y location. Basically worked with image coordinates and css transitions fired on the image objects once scrolling is tracked to a specific region in the Y axis. Interesting!

###Day 18: Januray 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 1:30 working on #Javascript30 HTML5 video player.

**Thoughts**: Fun ... good to have around for a template when a html5 video player might be needed. I actually took the end suggestion to keep going by adding a functional full screen button. 

###Day 17: Januray 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @WakaTime says 3:08 logged today. Re-creating said React app from yesterday. Plug in parts and trace the errors. Interesting half focused day. Football day!

**Thoughts**: Just working towards understand the entirety of the React app I'm implementing.

###Day 16: Januray 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @WakaTime says I coded 2 hours 12 minutes. Worked w/ the wakatime api a bit. CORS errors... Started a new create-react-app prototype of ddmachine using the [Conduit app framework here](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app). 

**Thoughts**: Basically stitching together the ddmachine site by disecting the code and writing a new create-react-app from scratch. Much time in the studying mode but keying it all in is good to get the practice, and I know it sinks in better when you key it in rather than copy/paste. No real site blueprint yet, other than consuming a few free services and scaffolding a good React app. Understanding the scaffolding is a must. 

###Day 15: Januray 13, 2017 (friday the 13th!)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Egghead.io React course / #Javascript30 lessons 9 and 10

**Thoughts**: More fun w/ #Javascript30 going over Chrome DevTool tricks and multiple checkbox selecting w/ JS. Started using WakaTime plugin for Webstorm. It tracks time spent coding in the editor. 3 hrs 7 mins today so far. May work more w/ my React/Redux project if Friday night gets dull.

###Day 14: Januray 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Egghead.io Using React to Build Web Applications 13 - 19

**Thoughts**: Continued React course keying in and studying the examples. Played around after commit adding my own things relative to the lesson. Learned a bit... getting it to sink in.

###Day 13: Januray 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Egghead.io Start Using React to Build Web Applications

**Thoughts**: Went through the first 12 lessons just watching on Chromecast, then rewatched them (pause/play/pause/...pause lol) while coding the examples. Trying to make this stuff 2nd nature. Getting better.

###Day 12: Januray 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascript30. Levels 6 and 7

**Thoughts**: #Javascript30 - Did Ajax type ahead using the `fetch` command to get ajax rather than axios or jquery. First I've heard of that. That sunk in well, so I continued onto Array cardio day 2. Used .some() .every() .find() and .findIndex() array methods.  

###Day 11: Januray 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of Javascript30. Flux (css) intro.

**Thoughts**: An hour of #javascript30 working with Flex (css). Framework for a flex panel gallery was provided and added css and javascript to bring the elements to life. Worked more with JS arrays today using a us zip codes .json data. Sorting, filtering... Data manipulation.


###Day 10: Januray 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of Javascript30. Array cardio

**Thoughts**: Solidifying array basics using .filter() .sort() .map() .reduce(). 
Initial build w/ ES5 and working in ES6 as clean up. Got well into section 6 of SGrider's MongoDB course. Kinda elementary so far but picking up things here and there. It's interesting to finally watch someone set up an environment and I'm a little bored! (learning).

###Day 9: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of Javascript30. Worked with vanilla JS and CSS using CSS variables.

**Thoughts**: Short day of coding. Plenty busy with a trip to the north shore. Looking forward to getting into Stephen Grider's 2 new courses on MongoDB and Webpack.

###Day 8: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Javascript30. Made a clock.

**Thoughts**: Having fun w/ vanilla javascript + css. Interesting. Published yesterday's project to Heroku. Tried it from 3 work computers. 2 of them would not even run the vanilla JS. The other one worked but wouldn't render the imgur background image (websense). Amazing how tight these systems are locked down. Sucks to be me. May continue w/ some React tonight.

###Day 7: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Javascript 30 program. 

**Thoughts**: Took a break from the React/Redux project and started Wes Bos' #Javascript30 program. Good fun building the Javascript Drum Kit project! Added my own touches, including a new key/.wav and background image. Deployed to heroku: [Kalihiwai Drum Scene with Foghorn!](https://jsdrumkit.herokuapp.com/index.html)

###Day 6: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Redux / Middleware construction

**Thoughts**: Continuance of day 5's progress. 

### Day 5: January 03, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More experimenting w/ React/Redux

**Thoughts:**: Starting to feel comfortable w/ the React framework. It's quite a mindshift from the old mindset. Venturing into the Redux store functionality using middlewares.

### Day 4: January 02, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More TDD / embedding script src into a React app / reactstrap

**Thoughts:**: Found a good free stock charting service [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/). Doesn't seem to be a trivial task embedding their provided scripts into my React project. That kinda put a speed bump in my day. Anyhow, I gave up on that for now and implemented a different reactstrap Navbar into the project. Read more of `Test driving javascript applications` ... good stuff. Positive / negative / exception testing.

### Day 3: January 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: added react-bootstrap and reactstrap to ddmachine project

**Thoughts:** Started out the day continuing to read `Test driving javascript applications`. Coded some simple examples. Will incorporate this strategy into ddmachine... writing tests first. Implemented bootstrap and a new navigation using reactstrap library.

### Day 2: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: not much

**Thoughts:** giggle... i knew it.. life took over today. No excuse, but its NYE fireworks time! Did get the project into GIT and published it to github. project name `ddmachine`

### Day 1: December 30, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Set up a `create-react-app` project. Using Webstorm. Refactored directory structure to use react-router. Got a few blank pages wired up.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised that by using create-react-app that there was structure changes required to incorporate react-router. I referenced other React starter templates that utilized router, redux, etc... All of those were templated different from the way create-react-app is structured. Took some re-trys and do-overs to finally get it running. Good learning.

### Day 0: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days program, beginning on 12/30/16.

**Thoughts:** Ironic timing... Am at the point of desiring to put together an application. 
Leaning towards a React/Nodejs project using an existing API. Considering Barcharts or EBay API.
