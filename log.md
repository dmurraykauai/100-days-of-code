## 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 49: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #Javascript30 

**Thoughts**:

###Day 48: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #Javascript30 Click and drag to scroll lesson.

**Thoughts**: Other than the js30 lesson, I deployed the voiceinator to heroku to share with friends and family. Nearly 3 hours of @wakatime logged. Good day.

###Day 47: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour customizing the Voiceinator app from the #Javascript30 course

**Thoughts**: Worked w/ google fonts, changed various colors in CSS and studied the core of the code.

###Day 46: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #Javascript30 binge on the flight from Seattle to Lihue. Lessons 22 - 26.

**Thoughts**: After almost a week, got back into an honest groove. Perfect time to do so on a 6 hour flight. I think I got in about 4 hours in. Built 2 different menu systems w/ animations. The speech synthesis lesson seems to require an internet connection. Will test my work when can. Sticky nav bar worked out nice, then after a short lesson on event bubbling control, created another cool navbar like used on stripe.com.

###Day 45: February 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #Javascript30; lesson 22 - Follow along link highlighting

**Thoughts**: Very interesting, using vanilla JS, adding the mouseenter event listener to all anchor tags, then run a function that uses the getBoundingClientRect() function to get the width/height and top/left coords, taking into consideration the scrolling x/y positions when determining the top/left coordinates. Function uses CSS to apply the width/height to the link object when moused over. CSS style is transformed onto the object using this function.

###Day 44: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back to #Javascript30; lesson 21 - geolocation based on speedometer and compass

**Thoughts**: This was cool, but pretty much requires a MAC in order to fake the speed properties. I followed along and understood the concepts and keyed in the code.

###Day 43: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Trying to deploy React app to `Now`

**Thoughts**: Was able to deploy the app to now.sh initially, but redeploys bring up errors and blows the whole tutorial sequence into the ditch. Something to figure out I suppose. Never heard of 'now' until `now` lol... not going to wrestle w/ this because doesn't seem worth it at this point. Heroku exists, right? Tutorial goes to github deployment, next chapter... will try that I guess.

###Day 42: February 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back to React course

**Thoughts**: Finished lesson 24 / authentication. Reviewed it a bit to let it resonate. Some parts went fast, so the review helps. Have kind of been in a slump, so to speak, due to the fast paced home building situation this week. Much done on that front, but looking forward to spending more time doing this instead of that. 

###Day 41: February 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Kocahava interview day

**Thoughts**: Interview went pretty good... no hire, but that's what I expected. It was great overall because I know where they are at and they know where I am at presently. Good chat with the overall manager and got to meet the UI dev team. Great group of people. Maybe there will be an opening in that facet within the next few months. My goal now is to take the knowledge I've been learning and roll it into my own application / portfolio type of presentation. I'm there, I know it. Time to do the do. Onward.

###Day 40: February 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: anothter light day, home building things while traveling

**Thoughts**: prepping for interview /w Kochava today. Just basically getting my head in order w/ all I've learned in the past several months, trying to prepare to make a good impression, at least. Fingers crossed.

###Day 39: February 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: light day, home building things while traveling

**Thoughts**: weak day of effort due to traveling and focusing on the new home w/ the contractor. Stumbled upon an awesome youtube https://youtu.be/AslncyG8whg on RxJS w/ Netflix developer. Very interesting stuff. No real IDE time this day, but I think this knowledge counts.

###Day 38: February 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: React course: Ch 23 and half of 24

**Thoughts**: @wakatime 1:41 - wife's birthday, so went skiing/boarding Schweitzer, then superbowl fun. After logged some quality time reviewing validation with PropTypes, then got half way through the Authentication chapter, using facebook/github/twitter to log into the app we're creating. Interesting... I always wanted to know how to do this. I'll finish this one up tomorrow.

###Day 37: February 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: React course: animation / ch 22

**Thoughts**: @wakatime 1:04 - spent some quality time working w/ the css transitions in the react app, understanding how they work and tweaking the elements around a bit.

###Day 36: February 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: React course debugging

**Thoughts**: @wakatime 2:22 so far. About to call it a night. Debugging through some react code I butchered during the flight yesterday. removeFromOrder={this.removeSomeOtherDamnObject} Good exercise!

###Day 35: February 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: coding on the plane to Portland

**Thoughts**: @wesbos react course; coded through ch 23 and viewed the rest on the plane. Unable to test because no wifi and firebase requires an internet bite. @wakatime 1:50 then just watched the remaining videos. Will go back and implement when wifi is available.

###Day 34: February 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @wakatime 1 hour minimum. @wesbos React course chapter 20

**Thoughts**: Basically soaked in all learned from lessons 1 - 20. 

###Day 33: Januray 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @wakatime 1 hour minimum. @wesbos React course chapter 18 - 19

**Thoughts**: Persisting state with Firebase and localStorage(). This course keeps getting better and better. Sinking in.

###Day 32: Januray 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @wakatime 2:34 - eact w/ @wesbos. Chapters 14 and 17. More working w/ state and props.

**Thoughts**: Interesting course. Moving into using Firebase for data persistence in ch 18. Seeing how all the parent / child component relationships are working and communicating between them with props and state.

###Day 31: Januray 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @wakatime 2:32 - #javascript30 Native speech recognition, then React w/ @wesbos. Chapters 12 and 13, React Router and understanding State. 

**Thoughts**: Lesson 20, native speech recognition was very interesting. I didn't know it was possible. Very cool. Spent like 45 minutes on that. Spent nearly 2 hours w/ the React course. Reviewed the React Router lesson, then spent much time on the State lesson. Very informative. I'll have to go through it again just to nail it down.

###Day 30: Januray 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Some udemy time with Todd McLeod and Anthony Alecia ... golang and javascript

**Thoughts**: Great Saturday. Fun and chores. Little codeing but made it to the table for a cumulative hour.

###Day 29: Januray 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #Javascript30 building web cam app w/ filters. More js interview questions review

**Thoughts**: It's actually good to be able to answer a few of these js interview questions and actually know the answer. Still some to learn. JS30 was a fun lesson today. @wakatime 1:04.

###Day 28: Januray 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours today going over Javascript interview questions. 

**Thoughts**: Basically going through several different sites w/ js interview questions and getting those basics straight. 

###Day 27: Januray 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 2:07 @Wakatime - Javascript common interview questions and #Javascript30 

**Thoughts**: Studied and wrote these 3 code examples: https://medium.freecodecamp.com/3-questions-to-watch-out-for-in-a-javascript-interview-725012834ccb#.d6974a7j0. Event delegation, using a function closure within a loop, and Debouncing / Throttling events such as scroll and resize. #Javascript30 adding up times with reduce(). Taking a list of video play times in <li>'s data-time attributes, throw then all into an array from their nodes. Calculate the seconds, then get the mod% / remainder of seconds, then the remaining seconds from the left over minutes. Gives HH:MM:SS value. 

###Day 26: Januray 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Basic Javascript studies / practice

**Thoughts**: Spent the minimal time (1 hour) going through common Javascript interview questions. Can't go wrong there...

###Day 25: Januray 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Monday #javascript30 after work. Read a little #YDKJS

**Thoughts**: Sorting .sort() an array of titles replace()ing out beginning articles such as 'a', 'the', 'an'. Re-read the 'this' section of YDKJS book. 

###Day 24: Januray 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: lazy day, but spent a little time w/ #javascript30

**Thoughts**: Busy day in the yard, then guest for dinner. Good day, little pc time :-)

###Day 23: Januray 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. #Javascript30 lesson 16 today. css text shadow on mouse move. 

**Thoughts**: Typical Saturday. Logged about an hour coding. @wakatime log keeps me accountable :-)

###Day 22: Januray 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @WakaTime 2:32 #javascript30 local storage and event delegation. Up to lesson 12 w/ @wesbos React course.

**Thoughts**: Javascript30 course was a longer one today... 30 minutes. Learned how to use localStorage and view that output in DevTools. Getting well into the React course by @wesbos. Starting to get more interesting as the prior lessons didn't give anything new (much). 

###Day 21: Januray 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox @wesbos course. Then started his React course. 

**Thoughts**: Wes is a good teacher. Got a grasp on flex. 

###Day twenty: Januray 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #javascript30 again for an hour

**Thoughts**: objects and arrays referenced vs copied. Buying more courses than i have brain to shove them into. Todd McLoud's goland webdev course, stephen grider just released 2 new courses. wesbos react course in the cart. Overwhelming myself, but those are my targets.

###Day 19: Januray 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 1:14 working with #Javascript30

**Thoughts**: Lessons 12 and 13: Key sequence detection. Worked more with JS event listeners and arrays. Got a solid understanding of the .splice method. .join method as well... converting array values to csv string and analyze. Lesson 13 would slide an image into its space once the page is scrolled half way down into the image's x/y location. Basically worked with image coordinates and css transitions fired on the image objects once scrolling is tracked to a specific region in the Y axis. Interesting!

###Day 18: Januray 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 1:30 working on #Javascript30 HTML5 video player.

**Thoughts**: Fun ... good to have around for a template when a html5 video player might be needed. I actually took the end suggestion to keep going by adding a functional full screen button. 

###Day 17: Januray 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @WakaTime says 3:08 logged today. Re-creating said React app from yesterday. Plug in parts and trace the errors. Interesting half focused day. Football day!

**Thoughts**: Just working towards understand the entirety of the React app I'm implementing.

###Day 16: Januray 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: @WakaTime says I coded 2 hours 12 minutes. Worked w/ the wakatime api a bit. CORS errors... Started a new create-react-app prototype of ddmachine using the [Conduit app framework here](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app). 

**Thoughts**: Basically stitching together the ddmachine site by disecting the code and writing a new create-react-app from scratch. Much time in the studying mode but keying it all in is good to get the practice, and I know it sinks in better when you key it in rather than copy/paste. No real site blueprint yet, other than consuming a few free services and scaffolding a good React app. Understanding the scaffolding is a must. 

###Day 15: Januray 13, 2017 (friday the 13th!)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Egghead.io React course / #Javascript30 lessons 9 and 10

**Thoughts**: More fun w/ #Javascript30 going over Chrome DevTool tricks and multiple checkbox selecting w/ JS. Started using WakaTime plugin for Webstorm. It tracks time spent coding in the editor. 3 hrs 7 mins today so far. May work more w/ my React/Redux project if Friday night gets dull.

###Day 14: Januray 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Egghead.io Using React to Build Web Applications 13 - 19

**Thoughts**: Continued React course keying in and studying the examples. Played around after commit adding my own things relative to the lesson. Learned a bit... getting it to sink in.

###Day 13: Januray 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Egghead.io Start Using React to Build Web Applications

**Thoughts**: Went through the first 12 lessons just watching on Chromecast, then rewatched them (pause/play/pause/...pause lol) while coding the examples. Trying to make this stuff 2nd nature. Getting better.

###Day 12: Januray 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascript30. Levels 6 and 7

**Thoughts**: #Javascript30 - Did Ajax type ahead using the `fetch` command to get ajax rather than axios or jquery. First I've heard of that. That sunk in well, so I continued onto Array cardio day 2. Used .some() .every() .find() and .findIndex() array methods.  

###Day 11: Januray 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of Javascript30. Flux (css) intro.

**Thoughts**: An hour of #javascript30 working with Flex (css). Framework for a flex panel gallery was provided and added css and javascript to bring the elements to life. Worked more with JS arrays today using a us zip codes .json data. Sorting, filtering... Data manipulation.


###Day 10: Januray 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of Javascript30. Array cardio

**Thoughts**: Solidifying array basics using .filter() .sort() .map() .reduce(). 
Initial build w/ ES5 and working in ES6 as clean up. Got well into section 6 of SGrider's MongoDB course. Kinda elementary so far but picking up things here and there. It's interesting to finally watch someone set up an environment and I'm a little bored! (learning).

###Day 9: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of Javascript30. Worked with vanilla JS and CSS using CSS variables.

**Thoughts**: Short day of coding. Plenty busy with a trip to the north shore. Looking forward to getting into Stephen Grider's 2 new courses on MongoDB and Webpack.

###Day 8: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Javascript30. Made a clock.

**Thoughts**: Having fun w/ vanilla javascript + css. Interesting. Published yesterday's project to Heroku. Tried it from 3 work computers. 2 of them would not even run the vanilla JS. The other one worked but wouldn't render the imgur background image (websense). Amazing how tight these systems are locked down. Sucks to be me. May continue w/ some React tonight.

###Day 7: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Javascript 30 program. 

**Thoughts**: Took a break from the React/Redux project and started Wes Bos' #Javascript30 program. Good fun building the Javascript Drum Kit project! Added my own touches, including a new key/.wav and background image. Deployed to heroku: [Kalihiwai Drum Scene with Foghorn!](https://jsdrumkit.herokuapp.com/index.html)

###Day 6: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Redux / Middleware construction

**Thoughts**: Continuance of day 5's progress. 

### Day 5: January 03, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More experimenting w/ React/Redux

**Thoughts:**: Starting to feel comfortable w/ the React framework. It's quite a mindshift from the old mindset. Venturing into the Redux store functionality using middlewares.

### Day 4: January 02, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More TDD / embedding script src into a React app / reactstrap

**Thoughts:**: Found a good free stock charting service [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/). Doesn't seem to be a trivial task embedding their provided scripts into my React project. That kinda put a speed bump in my day. Anyhow, I gave up on that for now and implemented a different reactstrap Navbar into the project. Read more of `Test driving javascript applications` ... good stuff. Positive / negative / exception testing.

### Day 3: January 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: added react-bootstrap and reactstrap to ddmachine project

**Thoughts:** Started out the day continuing to read `Test driving javascript applications`. Coded some simple examples. Will incorporate this strategy into ddmachine... writing tests first. Implemented bootstrap and a new navigation using reactstrap library.

### Day 2: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: not much

**Thoughts:** giggle... i knew it.. life took over today. No excuse, but its NYE fireworks time! Did get the project into GIT and published it to github. project name `ddmachine`

### Day 1: December 30, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Set up a `create-react-app` project. Using Webstorm. Refactored directory structure to use react-router. Got a few blank pages wired up.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised that by using create-react-app that there was structure changes required to incorporate react-router. I referenced other React starter templates that utilized router, redux, etc... All of those were templated different from the way create-react-app is structured. Took some re-trys and do-overs to finally get it running. Good learning.

### Day 0: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days program, beginning on 12/30/16.

**Thoughts:** Ironic timing... Am at the point of desiring to put together an application. 
Leaning towards a React/Nodejs project using an existing API. Considering Barcharts or EBay API.

**Link to work:** [My Github jungle of junk](https://github.com/dmurraykauai)
