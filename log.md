## 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 03, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More experimenting w/ React/Redux

**Thoughts:**: Starting to feel comfortable w/ the React framework. It's quite a mindshift from the old mindset. Venturing into the Redux store functionality using middlewares.

### Day 4: January 02, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More TDD / embedding script src into a React app / reactstrap

**Thoughts:**: Found a good free stock charting service [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/). Doesn't seem to be a trivial task embedding their provided scripts into my React project. That kinda put a speed bump in my day. Anyhow, I gave up on that for now and implemented a different reactstrap Navbar into the project. Read more of `Test driving javascript applications` ... good stuff. Positive / negative / exception testing.

### Day 3: January 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: added react-bootstrap and reactstrap to ddmachine project

**Thoughts:** Started out the day continuing to read `Test driving javascript applications`. Coded some simple examples. Will incorporate this strategy into ddmachine... writing tests first. Implemented bootstrap and a new navigation using reactstrap library.

### Day 2: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: not much

**Thoughts:** giggle... i knew it.. life took over today. No excuse, but its NYE fireworks time! Did get the project into GIT and published it to github. project name `ddmachine`

### Day 1: December 30, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Set up a `create-react-app` project. Using Webstorm. Refactored directory structure to use react-router. Got a few blank pages wired up.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised that by using create-react-app that there was structure changes required to incorporate react-router. I referenced other React starter templates that utilized router, redux, etc... All of those were templated different from the way create-react-app is structured. Took some re-trys and do-overs to finally get it running. Good learning.

### Day 0: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days program, beginning on 12/30/16.

**Thoughts:** Ironic timing... Am at the point of desiring to put together an application. 
Leaning towards a React/Nodejs project using an existing API. Considering Barcharts or EBay API.
