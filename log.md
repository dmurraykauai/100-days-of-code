## 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: not much

**Thoughts:** giggle... i knew it.. life took over today. No excuse, but its NYE fireworks time! Did get the project into GIT and published it to github. project name `ddmachine`

### Day 1: December 30, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Set up a `create-react-app` project. Using Webstorm. Refactored directory structure to use react-router. Got a few blank pages wired up.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised that by using create-react-app that there was structure changes required to incorporate react-router. I referenced other React starter templates that utilized router, redux, etc... All of those were templated different from the way create-react-app is structured. Took some re-trys and do-overs to finally get it running. Good learning.

### Day 0: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days program, beginning on 12/30/16.

**Thoughts:** Ironic timing... Am at the point of desiring to put together an application. 
Leaning towards a React/Nodejs project using an existing API. Considering Barcharts or EBay API.
