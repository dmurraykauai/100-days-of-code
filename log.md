## 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 12: Januray 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascript30. Levels 6 and 7

**Thoughts**: #Javascript30 - Did Ajax type ahead using the `fetch` command to get ajax rather than axios or jquery. First I've heard of that. That sunk in well, so I continued onto Array cardio day 2. Used .some() .every() .find() and .findIndex() array methods.  

###Day 11: Januray 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of Javascript30. Flux (css) intro.

**Thoughts**: An hour of #javascript30 working with Flex (css). Framework for a flex panel gallery was provided and added css and javascript to bring the elements to life. Worked more with JS arrays today using a us zip codes .json data. Sorting, filtering... Data manipulation.


###Day 10: Januray 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of Javascript30. Array cardio

**Thoughts**: Solidifying array basics using .filter() .sort() .map() .reduce(). 
Initial build w/ ES5 and working in ES6 as clean up. Got well into section 6 of SGrider's MongoDB course. Kinda elementary so far but picking up things here and there. It's interesting to finally watch someone set up an environment and I'm a little bored! (learning).

###Day 9: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of Javascript30. Worked with vanilla JS and CSS using CSS variables.

**Thoughts**: Short day of coding. Plenty busy with a trip to the north shore. Looking forward to getting into Stephen Grider's 2 new courses on MongoDB and Webpack.

###Day 8: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Javascript30. Made a clock.

**Thoughts**: Having fun w/ vanilla javascript + css. Interesting. Published yesterday's project to Heroku. Tried it from 3 work computers. 2 of them would not even run the vanilla JS. The other one worked but wouldn't render the imgur background image (websense). Amazing how tight these systems are locked down. Sucks to be me. May continue w/ some React tonight.

###Day 7: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Javascript 30 program. 

**Thoughts**: Took a break from the React/Redux project and started Wes Bos' #Javascript30 program. Good fun building the Javascript Drum Kit project! Added my own touches, including a new key/.wav and background image. Deployed to heroku: [Kalihiwai Drum Scene with Foghorn!](https://jsdrumkit.herokuapp.com/index.html)

###Day 6: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Redux / Middleware construction

**Thoughts**: Continuance of day 5's progress. 

### Day 5: January 03, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More experimenting w/ React/Redux

**Thoughts:**: Starting to feel comfortable w/ the React framework. It's quite a mindshift from the old mindset. Venturing into the Redux store functionality using middlewares.

### Day 4: January 02, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More TDD / embedding script src into a React app / reactstrap

**Thoughts:**: Found a good free stock charting service [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/). Doesn't seem to be a trivial task embedding their provided scripts into my React project. That kinda put a speed bump in my day. Anyhow, I gave up on that for now and implemented a different reactstrap Navbar into the project. Read more of `Test driving javascript applications` ... good stuff. Positive / negative / exception testing.

### Day 3: January 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: added react-bootstrap and reactstrap to ddmachine project

**Thoughts:** Started out the day continuing to read `Test driving javascript applications`. Coded some simple examples. Will incorporate this strategy into ddmachine... writing tests first. Implemented bootstrap and a new navigation using reactstrap library.

### Day 2: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: not much

**Thoughts:** giggle... i knew it.. life took over today. No excuse, but its NYE fireworks time! Did get the project into GIT and published it to github. project name `ddmachine`

### Day 1: December 30, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Set up a `create-react-app` project. Using Webstorm. Refactored directory structure to use react-router. Got a few blank pages wired up.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised that by using create-react-app that there was structure changes required to incorporate react-router. I referenced other React starter templates that utilized router, redux, etc... All of those were templated different from the way create-react-app is structured. Took some re-trys and do-overs to finally get it running. Good learning.

### Day 0: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days program, beginning on 12/30/16.

**Thoughts:** Ironic timing... Am at the point of desiring to put together an application. 
Leaning towards a React/Nodejs project using an existing API. Considering Barcharts or EBay API.
